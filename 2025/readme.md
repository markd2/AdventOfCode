# AoC 2025

This year, VAX Pascal!  Yay!

Development on simh emulating a VAX 8600.  Thanks to Dave McGuire and
Terri Kennedy for getting me set up with a working programmable 
VAX/VMS (7.something) image.

No real running commentary this year.  Mainly using this as an
excuse to refresh my Pascal chops (the LSSM has a PERQ that's getting
up and running, and the programming docs are in Pascal).  I have
some _plans_ for that machine.
